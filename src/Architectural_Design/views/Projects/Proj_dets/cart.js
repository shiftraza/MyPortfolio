            <p className="description">
              At this manufacturing facility, there was a need to transport
              sensitive parts throughout the plant. The painted aluminum parts
              were prone to scratching which resulted in QC issues. I was tasked
              to design a cart capable of transporting aluminum cladding of
              different sizes through multiple different processes throughout
              the whole facility. The finalized design would replace the aging
              transports throughout the shop. 20 units were produced and due to
              the customizable design, were easy to use produce in a variety of
              different sizes to accommodate even more parts. Each cart cost a
              total of 1500 dollars.
